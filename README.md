# doggo_finder_webscraper
Exercises a bit with webscraping using selenium with python. I started this when I realized that one of my favorite local animal rescue websites doesn't really offer any way of receiving updates when a new dog is added to the list. It's being enough of a frustrating experience so far that I thought I could try to learn a bit of webscraping methods. If you are looking for rigorous, clean stuff, be advised that this might not be the right place (:

## Requirements
I'm using Python 3.8 with Anaconda. Dependencies so far are:
* selenium (version 3.141.0)
* webdriver_manager (version 3.2.1)
I'm mainly developing under Linux and Windows.
